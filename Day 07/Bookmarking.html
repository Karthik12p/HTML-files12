    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p id="HTML">
        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and stdivcture of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the stdivcture of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

    <p  id="CSS">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the stdivctural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p id="JS">
        JavaScript is a programming language used for creating dynamic content on websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform and single-threaded programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility. It is a commonly used programming language to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications. It is easy to learn. JavaScript is an essential programming language for web developers to learn as it grows rapidly. JavaScript is responsible for behaviour of the web pages. By learning it, you will develop skills in web development.
